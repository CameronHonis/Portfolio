NOTES:
- linear gradients for fog isn't completely accurate, approximations of closest/furthest points on triangle are made to be one vertices, doesn't consider points on edges of tri
- tri face colors (pre-fog shader) are approximated to be one solid color

POTENTIAL OPTIMIZATIONS:
1. draw adjacent triangles as one polygon in canvas
2. approximate triangles, combining adjacent orthagonal trianges (or approximately orthagonal to a certain threshold angle), removing triangles below certain area threshold
3. consider ray-tracing approach
4. sort renderTris by max BB limits so that when iterating negations, can potentially initiate iteration further down the array
5. avoid computing baseFaceColor (w respect to reflections) of triangles not rendered
6. cut screenposs of tris that clip off screen to only include regions on screen to avoid calcing negations off screen
